# spam-email-classifier

An explainable spam email classification system that analyzes email content using linguistic and structural patterns to identify spam messages in a transparent and interpretable manner.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Spam Email Detector** is designed to classify emails as **Spam** or **Legitimate** based on commonly observed textual patterns rather than opaque predictions. The system focuses on **heuristic-based Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to demonstrate how spam detection works at a foundational level.

Instead of using black-box machine learning models, this project emphasizes **explainability**, allowing users to understand *why* an email is flagged as spam.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Demonstrate core NLP concepts used in spam detection  
- Highlight linguistic and structural spam indicators  
- Provide transparent and explainable classification results  
- Build a clean, beginner-friendly AI project for learning and evaluation  

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Spam vs Legitimate email classification  
- Detection of promotional and urgency-based keywords  
- Analysis of suspicious language patterns  
- Explainable output showing reasons for classification  
- Simple and intuitive web-based interface

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user pastes an email message into the input box  
2. The system scans the text for spam-related patterns such as:
   - Promotional keywords  
   - Urgency indicators  
   - Repetitive or suspicious phrases  
3. A rule-based score is calculated  
4. The email is classified as **Spam** or **Not Spam**  
5. The system explains the reasoning behind the decision  

⚠️ This approach demonstrates **pattern-based classification**, not probabilistic learning.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- No machine learning or statistical modeling  
- Keyword-based heuristics only  
- Language-dependent detection rules  
- Cannot detect highly sophisticated or obfuscated spam
